🎱 Billiard Game Simulation with Python & CoppeliaSim
This project is an interactive billiard game simulation built using Python and CoppeliaSim through the ZMQ Remote API.
Players can input force and torque via the terminal to control the cue ball (white ball). The simulation supports a multiplayer turn-based system, integrates physics-based motion and collision dynamics, and demonstrates the application of real-world physics in a computational environment.

🔹 Key Features:
Player input for force and torque through terminal.
Multiplayer turn-based system (alternating shots).
Physics-based collision and realistic ball movement.
Terminal logs showing ball positions before and after shots.
Planned extensions: scoring system, visualization, and GitHub documentation (README, demo video).

🔹 Tech Stack:
Language: Python
Simulation Platform: CoppeliaSim
API: ZMQ Remote API

🔹 Learning Outcomes:
Applied physics concepts (force, torque, momentum, collision) in a simulated environment.
Hands-on experience in Python API integration with CoppeliaSim.
Improved skills in simulation control, debugging, and documentation.
